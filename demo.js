        <p>As the size of CSS resources used in a project increases, a development team often needs to decide on a common
          design methodology to keep them organized. The goals are ease of development, ease of collaboration during
          development and performance of the deployed stylesheets in the browser. Popular methodologies include OOCSS
          (object oriented CSS), ACSS (atomic CSS), oCSS (organic Cascade Style Sheet), SMACSS (scalable and modular
          architecture for CSS), and BEM (block, element, modifier).</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document
            written in a markup language like HTML.</li>
          <li>CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.
            This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification
            of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS
            in a separate .css file, and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural content.</li>
          <li>Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different
            styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or
            screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the
            content is accessed on a mobile device.</li>

        <p>To understand the subtle differences between HTML and XHTML, consider the transformation of a valid and

        <p>Those are the main changes necessary to translate a document from XHTML 1.0 to HTML 4.01. To translate from
          HTML to XHTML would also require the addition of any omitted opening or closing tags. Whether coding in HTML or
          XHTML it may just be best to always include the optional tags within an HTML document rather than remembering
          which tags can be omitted.</p>
        <p>A well-formed XHTML document adheres to all the syntax requirements of XML. A valid document adheres to the
